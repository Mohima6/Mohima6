# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohima!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a EEE sophomore, passionate developer and researcher exploring the intersection of **machine learning**, **robotics**, **IoT**, and **software engineering**. I love turning innovative ideas into functional code—whether it's a brain-controlled robot or a Java-based Pac-Man game!
